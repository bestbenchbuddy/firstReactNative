# firstReactNative

My first react-native iOS project using Expo

How to install/run
1. Make sure you have node installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install expo via the command line: npm install -g expo-cli
3. Run the app in the root directory using the command: expo start.  

Usage:
1.  Typing in the search bar will match all words (seperated by spaces) with data pretaining to movies.
2.  Clicking on one of the search results will use react navigation to take you to another screen holding more information about the selected movie title.
